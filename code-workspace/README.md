This folder contains the .ipynb file. For ease of running and because we don't want to Docker, the following instructions apply to using Colab.
- Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and click "New Notebook". When it loads, on your top left, you'll see **File**. Please click it and select **Upload Notebook**.
- You should have downloaded the .ipynb by this time and you should just drag and drop.
- It should load beautifully.
- The next thing to look at is the data. The datasets are the xlsx files that are in the following folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w7Qb2Z5a5ubon5Pyl0b3jp3Gbhzyvuqx?usp=sharing.
- Download it and get ready to move the **test_dataframes.xlsx** and the **train_dataframes.xlsx**.
- Create a folder in your Google Drive called "Elorm's Work" (this is so that you don't have to modify the code. if you want to modify, you can name it anything and then in the second cell of your notebook, you edit the string that was _/content/drive/MyDrive/**Elorm's Work**/test_dataframes.xlsx_ to _/content/drive/MyDrive/**{new name of folder}**/test_dataframes.xlsx_. Be sure to change both the test and train dataframes.)
- After folder creation, drag and drop the two xlsx files into the folder.
- You can start running the code from the top. I am using seeds so the same result I get is the same you'll get.
