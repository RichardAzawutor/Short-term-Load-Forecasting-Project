Hello Elorm,
This repo contains everything about the project. If you want me to even record a video explaining what is going ahh, I will. But to make sure that everyone understands, I'll add a few videos about buidling an MLPS, CNN, RNN and an LSTM in Python.
The folder structure is simple. The "**only-work**" contains the pdf and the powerpoint. the "**code-workspace**" contains the ipynb needed to run the code with the files needed to run it. There's another README there that'll give you clarity on what to do but it basically involves creating a folder in your google drive named "**Elorm's Work**" and then you upload the two xlsx files I've added to it. I've also added some information about the validity and the source of the data so that you can explain it if it ever comes up. The "**tex-workspace**" contains a zip file that when directly uploaded to **Overleaf**, allows you to edit the actual file and add a few things.
If there's anything I've forgotten, please lemme know by calling or email (officialpaapa@gmail.com)
